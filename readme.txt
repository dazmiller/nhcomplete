For OpenCart version 2.3.+

vQmod required (https://github.com/vqmod/vqmod/releases).

Installation:
1. Upload all files to your root directory.
2. Enable view/modify settings for the usergroup.


This extension is made to work with the default opencart admin theme in English (but can be translated easily). I make no guarantees that this extension will work with any customizations you may have already made to your cart.
